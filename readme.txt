Problem Statement:

AtliQo, one of Indiaâ€™s leading telecom providers, launched its 5G plans in May 2022, alongside other major telecom players. However, following the launch, the management observed a decline in active users and revenue growth. To address this, the business director has asked the analytics team to compare key performance indicators (KPIs) from the pre- and post-5G periods. The aim is to gain insights that will help recover active user rates and improve overall performance. Additionally, management is exploring ways to optimize their internet plans to attract more active users.

Key Insights:

Revenue dropped by 0.50% after the 5G launch.
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) increased by 11.05%.
Monthly active users declined by 8.28%.
Monthly unsubscribers increased by 23.5%.
Internet combo plans are performing well.
PIO holds the highest market share.
The top 5 plans account for 69.7% of revenue.
Revenue is forecasted to increase over the next 6 months.
Plan 1 generates the highest revenue.
This analysis will help management make data-driven decisions to optimize their strategies and recover user engagement.
